Feature Selection Method:
n this data science assignment, I employ varied feature selection methods – filter, wrapper, and embedded – utilizing logistic regression. The assignment encompasses thorough data wrangling, preprocessing.
SCRATCH CODES:
Explore the power of regression through Scratch code in this repository, covering one variable and multiple variables scenarios. Witness the application of this fundamental machine learning technique in practical contexts, such as Bitcoin price forecasting. Additionally, a scikit-learn-based linear regression estimated model is showcased, utilizing essential libraries like scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy.
